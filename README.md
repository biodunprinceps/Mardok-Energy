Mart Dok Petroleum — Static Tailwind demo

This repository contains a static, responsive, modern landing page for a petroleum company (Mart Dok Petroleum).

What's included

- `index.html`: Main static page built with the Tailwind CDN. Includes hero, services, pricing, order form, FAQ, blog preview, contact section with an embedded map, a floating WhatsApp button, newsletter, and testimonials.
- `logo.png`: Company logo used in the layout.

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a static server for local testing).
2. The site uses Tailwind CDN for styling; no additional build steps required.

Customization

- Update the brand color in the `tailwind.config` block at the top of `index.html`.
- Replace placeholder content, images, and the WhatsApp phone number as needed.

Notes

- The contact and order forms are demo-only and will not send data to a server. For production, wire the forms to a backend API.
